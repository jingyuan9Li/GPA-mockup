        <p class="paper">Great Panda Association (GPA) is a global orgnization commited to protect rare things. Well, there are many kinds of rare stuff out there, but what are the most valuable among them? That is our job to find out! We chose the adorable great panda as our symbol and brand to emphasize our belief. There is a saying: "When a thing is scarce, it is precious." in an ancient east country, and we have to respect their wisdom: there is nothing more valuable than rare belongings!</p>
